# Why Vote?
Voting is the easiest way to help the server grow. It only takes a few seconds to vote. You also get rewarded for voting. Every 28 votes (1 week of voting every day), you get a reward multiplier. After 28 votes, you get 2x rewards, 56 votes: 3x, and so on. Also every vote is cast into a lottery for a big prize at the end of the month. The more you vote, the more likely you are to win the draw. If you are the winner, you get to pick your price! _(as long as its within reason and within MC TOS)_
