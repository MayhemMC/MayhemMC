5. The punishment may vary from a temporary mute to a permanent ban from the Discord server. Typically bans are only used if Discord's TOS is violated.
6. Punishments are up to the Discord Mod‚Äôs discretion, their decision is final, do not ping or DM me or any mod if you don‚Äôt like the outcome of something you did.
7. If you are insulted inside an NSFW channel, do not ping a mod. Toxicity is allowed inside NSFW channels. If you don‚Äôt like this, change your notification settings to mute those channels.
8. Do not spam. Yes, this is a no-üß†er, this includes typing a bulk amount of messages in a row. If this seems to be a struggle for you, before you send, wait a few seconds and think, ‚Äúwhat did I forget to add‚Äù and add it, Don‚Äôt be afraid to edit messages too. _(6 messages in a row in under 5 minutes is considered spam)_
