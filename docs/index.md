# Welcome
Welcome to Mayhem MC!

The High Performance Minecraft Survival Games Network.

Server IP: `mayhemmc.uk.to`

I opened Mayhem MC on May 7th, 2020. Looking for a good server network to play on, unfortunately I wasn't able to find any that satisfied me. My search criteria went along the lines of always updated, high TPS and most importantly: not pay to win. Not finding any servers with all 3, I made my own. Even though I don't play as an actual player, I enjoy providing a high quality Minecraft experience to everyone else, even though I don't benefit from my original needs as an owner.

# Vote
Make sure you vote everyday for rewards with `/vote`. After each week of voting, you hit a milestone and your rewards **double**. Even if you don't need the rewards, voting greatly helps the server grow and you should do it anyway. Each month the top voter gets a prize of their choice which is very worthwhile for a long months of voting.

# Donate
Donating is a great way to support the server. Donations go back into making the server better, the money raised is used to upgrade hardware, develop new server types, ect. Donators get ranks that are not pay to win, which is hard to find nowadays. Donator ranks provide both cosmetic and convenience perks. I usually ask donators for their opinions on how to improve the server aswell. All donators get their Discord role and access to the `donator-only` channels on the Discord server.
